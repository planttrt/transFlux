# TransFlux
Estimating forest transpiration flux from satellite 

###Theory
 - Energy Balance
 - Water use affects canopy energy balance

###Data
 - Sattelite Observation of surface temperature
 - Field climate data
 - Individual measurements of trees transpiration

###Model
  - Bayesian Model
  - Physics-based


###Questions
1) Can canopy remotely sensed thermal stress tell us about the water use in plot scale? What are the sources of uncertainty in different atmospheric and site specific conditions? 

2) How thermal stress has beed geographically distributed acroos biomes? What are the estimates of interannual variation of transpirations?
